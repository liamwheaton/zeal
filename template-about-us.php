					<div class="rcol-content">Our pets give us so much unconditional love and it is often taken  for granted. They are there for us in so many ways, and it's proven scientifically that having pets around as a part of our lives, makes us happier people. We can return their love by taking care of them with affection and understanding and very importantly, by feeding them a healthy diet. Our products are made with genuine care by the family of staff and management and we promise not to compromise on the natural goodness of the food we create.

						Our prime driver is to reconnect human beings with nature, and profiteering is not a focus. We live in a world of great change where truthfulness takes centre stage. Here at NPTC we stand behind every ingredient and description with integrity. Our business is built on a spirit first attitude where we connect with our inner core of who we are and remind ourselves through our work and service of our honesty, dedication and integrity. We can learn so much by bonding with our pets as animals are so much closer to nature than humans, still retaining their intuition and instinct. The concept of unconditional love is incorporated into the business. Like a mother's cooking, the unconditional love translates into the products.
