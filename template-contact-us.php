					Our prime driver is to reconnect human beings with nature, and profiteering is not a focus. We live in a world of great change where truthfulness takes centre stage. Here at NPTC we stand behind every ingredient and description with integrity. Our business is built on a spirit first attitude where we connect with our inner core of who we are and remind ourselves through our work and service of our honesty, dedication and integrity. We can learn so much by bonding with our pets as animals are so much closer to nature than humans, still retaining their intuition and instinct. The concept of unconditional love is incorporated into the business. Like a mother's cooking, the unconditional love translates into the products.
